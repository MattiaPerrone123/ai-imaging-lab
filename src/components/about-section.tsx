              I'm a Research Scientist with 3+ years of experience in machine learning applied to the medical field. 
              At Rush University Medical Center, I focus on low back pain through complementary AI approaches involving 
              vision-language models for MRI report generation, deep learning analysis of spine metabolism on PET-CT and 
              biopsychosocial modeling from tabular data.
            </p>

              Before joining Rush, I worked at Arcadia University, where I specialized in machine learning applied to hip 
              and knee biomechanics. I developed predictive deep learning models for time series motion
               analysis variables and designed an AI-based generative framework for producing synthetic motion analysis 
               data.

               I have a background in biomedical engineering and completed a dual Masterâ€™s Degree program in the same 
               field between the University of Illinois Chicago and Politecnico di Milano.
